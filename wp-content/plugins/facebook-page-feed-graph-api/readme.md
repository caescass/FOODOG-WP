Other features include:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happened to "Show Posts"?
The latest version of the API has removed show posts and replaced it with `tabs` which is more dynamic. To show just the posts, your tabs value should be "timeline". To hide the posts, `tabs` should be empty (shortcode) or select "none" (widget). If you're using the shortcode, remember that by default it shows the timeline so you must set it as either an empty or false value to hide posts ie `tabs=""` or `tabs="false"`. If the posts option is already being used it will be converted to tabs.

### What languages are available?
As of version 1.2.0, the plugin is available in all languages provided by Facebook ( full list availabe [here](https://www.facebook.com/translations/FacebookLocales.xml) ). By default it uses the same language as the site, but alternatively you can specify the language in the shortcode. The dashboard widget is currently only available in English but is multilingual ready.

### My Facebook page isn't loading
If the URL for your page is http://facebook.com/ABC123 then when you use the shortcode don't include the domain, instead use like so: `[facebook-page-plugin href="ABC123"]`
Also, if your page has only just been created it may take some time for the API to load the page. Just be patient

### What versions of WordPress will this plugin work on? ###
Shortcodes were introduced in WordPress 2.5, so theorectially it should work on all sites that are at least 2.5, however it has only been tested on versions 4.0 and up, and no guarantee will be made concerning earlier versions

### I can only see a link, the plugin won't load
By default the plugin will display a link to your page while the page plugin loads. If the page plugin doesn't load, this could happen for a number of reasons. Your connection could be very slow, you could have JavaScript disabled, you could have an ad blocker or similar browser extension blocking the plugin or there could be an error in the information you have provided in the widget or shortcode.
Additionally, if your Facebook page has audience restrictions for age and/or location, the plugin will not display. If you want the plugin to display, disable the audience restrictions in your page settings on Facebook.

### I can't get the Facepile to work!
Chances are your plugin isn't tall enough to display the facepile properly. The facepile requires the plugin to have a minimum height of 214 pixels, or 154 pixel if using the small header.

## Plugin Settings

The Facebook Page Plugin uses a shortcode to insert the page feed. You set your settings within the shortcode.
`[facebook-page-plugin setting="value"]` 
Available settings: 

`href` (URL path that comes after facebook.com/)

`width` (number, in pixels, between 180 and 500, default 340)

`height` (number, in pixels, minimum 70, default 500)

`cover` (true/false, show page cover photo, default true)

`facepile` (true/false, show facepile, default true)

`tabs` (any combination of [posts, messages, events], default timeline)

`cta` (true/false, hide custom call to action if applicable, default false)

`small` (true/false, display small header (must be true for height to be lower than 130px), default false)

`adapt` (true/false, force plugin to be responsive, default true)

`language` (languageCode_countryCode eg: en_US, language of the plugin, default site language)

* Deprecated Settings *

`posts` (true/false) - posts has been replaced by tabs as of 1.4.0. There is a fallback in place to convert it to tabs

Example: `[facebook-page-plugin href="facebook" width="300" height="500" cover="true" facepile="true" tabs="timeline" adapt="true"]`
This will display a Facebook page feed that loads in the page `facebook.com/facebook` that is 300px wide but adapts to it's container, 500px high, displaying the page's cover photo, facepile and recent posts in the same language as the site. See the screenshots tab for a demonstration of how it will appear
